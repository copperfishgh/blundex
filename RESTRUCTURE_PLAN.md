# RESTRUCTURE PLAN - Mega-Loop Board Analysis
## Draft 2 (Bitboard-Optimized) - FINAL

This document outlines the plan to consolidate all board analysis into a single-pass mega-loop that eliminates redundant square iterations **AND** leverages python-chess bitboard operations for maximum performance.

### Changes from Draft 1 â†’ Draft 2
1. **Iterate `board.occupied`** instead of `chess.SQUARES` (25 vs 64 iterations)
2. **Keep SquareSet objects** instead of converting to Python `set()` for O(1) operations
3. **Use FILE_MASKS** for instant pawn file queries via bitboard AND operations
4. **Bitboard rank masks** for passed pawn detection (single mask check vs nested loops)
5. **Removed `by_file` dictionary** - use bitboard operations directly
6. **Simplified pin detection** - use `board.is_pinned()` only (no relative pins)
7. **Use bitboard `~self.board.pawns`** to exclude pawns from pin checks

**See BITBOARD_ANALYSIS.md for detailed rationale**

### Python-Chess Caching Behavior
**Important:** Python-chess does NOT cache results for expensive operations like `attackers()` or `is_pinned()`. They are computed fresh each time. This validates our mega-loop caching strategy as highly valuable.

---

## Current Problem

Multiple methods iterate over all 64 squares independently:
- `get_hanging_pieces()` - iterates squares, checks attackers/defenders
- `count_attacked_pieces()` - iterates squares, checks attackers
- `get_pinned_pieces()` - iterates squares, checks attackers + ray-casting
- `count_pawns()` - iterates squares
- `count_backward_pawns()` - iterates squares, checks adjacent files
- `count_isolated_pawns()` - iterates squares, checks adjacent files
- `count_doubled_pawns()` - iterates squares, checks same file
- `count_passed_pawns()` - iterates squares, checks files -1,0,+1

**Estimated redundancy: 60-75%**

Additionally, Draft 1 identified these bitboard optimization opportunities:
- Iterating all 64 squares instead of only occupied squares (~25 pieces)
- Converting SquareSet to Python `set()`, losing O(1) bitboard operations
- Manual dictionary tracking for pawn files instead of bitboard FILE_MASKS

## Proposed Solution: Bitboard-Optimized Mega-Loop

### High-Level Structure

```python
class BoardState:
    def __init__(self):
        # Analysis cache - computed once per position
        self._analysis = None

    def _invalidate_analysis(self):
        """Called after any move to invalidate cached analysis"""
        self._analysis = None

    def _compute_board_analysis(self):
        """
        BITBOARD-OPTIMIZED MEGA-LOOP: Single pass through occupied squares using
        python-chess bitboard operations for maximum performance.

        KEY OPTIMIZATIONS:
        1. Iterate board.occupied (~25 pieces) instead of chess.SQUARES (64)
        2. Keep SquareSet objects for O(1) bitboard operations
        3. Use FILE_MASKS for instant pawn file-based queries

        Returns a dictionary containing all computed board metrics.

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Mega-Loop Benefits (Draft 1)
1. **Eliminated redundant iterations**: From ~10 separate loops to 1 mega-loop
2. **Attack computation**: From N calls to `board.attackers()` to 1 pass
3. **Pawn analysis**: From 4 separate passes to 1 pass with file-based organization
4. **Pin detection**: Uses cached attack data instead of recomputing

**Mega-loop speedup: 3-5x**

### Bitboard Optimizations (Draft 2)
1. **Iterate board.occupied**: ~25 piece iterations instead of 64 square iterations (2.5x fewer)
2. **SquareSet operations**: O(1) popcount instead of O(n) Python len() on sets
3. **FILE_MASKS for pawns**: Instant bitwise AND for file queries instead of dictionary lookups
4. **Passed pawn detection**: Single bitboard mask check instead of nested loops
5. **No set() conversions**: Keep SquareSet throughout for bitboard performance

**Additional bitboard speedup: 3-4x**

**Combined estimated speedup: 10-15x for full board analysis**

## Migration Strategy

1. Add `_compute_board_analysis()` mega-loop method
2. Add `_ensure_analysis()` lazy computation wrapper
3. Modify existing public methods to use cached results
4. Add `_invalidate_analysis()` calls to all move methods
5. Test thoroughly to ensure behavioral equivalence
6. Remove old implementation once verified

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement `_compute_board_analysis()` mega-loop in chess_board.py
- [ ] Add `_ensure_analysis()` lazy computation wrapper
- [ ] Modify existing public methods to use cached results
- [ ] Add `_invalidate_analysis()` calls to all move methods (make_move, undo_move, redo_move)
- [ ] Test thoroughly to ensure behavioral equivalence with current code
- [ ] Profile performance to measure actual speedup
- [ ] Verify all edge cases (endgames with few pieces, pawn-heavy positions)

## Future Tactical Pattern Detection

Python-chess does NOT provide built-in detection for these patterns. We'll need to implement them ourselves using the primitives (`attacks()`, `attackers()`, ray-casting):

### To Implement Later
- [ ] **Forks** - One piece attacking 2+ valuable enemy pieces
- [ ] **Skewers** - Attacking valuable piece with less valuable piece behind it on ray
- [ ] **X-rays** - Piece "seeing through" another piece to square behind
- [ ] **Discovered attacks** - Moving piece reveals attack from piece behind

These would fit naturally into the mega-loop structure since they need attack information already being computed.
